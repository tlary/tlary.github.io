      <title>Streamlit: Deploying ML Models the easy way</title>

      <description>In this blogpost I describe the process of building a good-looking ML App using Streamlit. The app again implements the genre classification model, however the whole process is much easier and faster.</description>

      <description>After building and training a ML model, the next step to actually generate business value is to deploy the model so that it can be used in production. In this blog I build a small App and deploy the genre classification model built in the last blogpost on Heroku.</description>

      <guid>/post/genreclassifier/</guid>
      <description>In this project I build a neural net to classify songs into one of three genres based on their lyrics. The lyrics are obtained via the lyricsgenius package and the model is built with the powerful fastai library.</description>

      <title>A Forecast a day keeps the Doctor away - Predicting Influenza Rates</title>
      <link>/post/curaio_clean/</link>

      <guid>/post/curaio_clean/</guid>
      <description>The aim of the project is to predict disease rates, more precisely influenza-like illnesses rates (ILI rates). On the one hand historical time series data were used, on the other hand the data basis was extended by Google Trends data.</description>

      <title>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - 2021 Update: Streamlit</title>
      <link>/post/titanic/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/titanic/</guid>
      <description>This blogpost contains code for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic&#34;&gt;Kaggle Titanic challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It is a well-known beginner challenge and its goal is to build a binary classification model to predict if passengers would have survived the Titanic disaster or not. The focus of this blogpost is on Exploratory Data Analysis and some Feature Engineering. Later on, I built and deployed a small ML app using Streamlit and Streamlit Sharing.</description>
